## Research Highlights
I use web-based cognitive tasks, brain imaging, eye-tracking, and machine learning to study how the internal and external environment affects human decision-making. My current research focuses on (1) neurocognitive mechanisms of math anxiety and math avoidance, (2) neurocognitive benefits of the superior pedestrian experience, and (3) neurocognitive impacts of heat stress on self-control and aggression. During my PhD, I studied the role of human primary visual cortex in perceptual decision-making.

### Web-based Cognitive Tasks
These tasks are based on [the jsPsych library](https://www.jspsych.org/) and have been used in my research with Qualtrics. You can try these right now! NOTE: These tasks are **NOT** designed to work on mobile phones and tablets.

* [The Choose-And-Solve Task](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/choose-and-solve-task.html): An effort-based decision-making task for measuring math avoidance [(Choe et al., 2019, *Science Advances*)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaay1062). [\[demo\]](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/choose-and-solve-task.html) [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/CAST_jsPsych) [\[data\]](https://osf.io/t4wju/) [\[problem set\]](https://github.com/kywch/CAST_jsPsych/tree/master/problem-set)
* [Multi-Image Rating Task](https://kywch.github.io/ImageRatingStudy/multi-rating.html): An efficient method for rating images (work-in-progress) vs. [pairwise image rating](https://kywch.github.io/ImageRatingStudy/pair-rating.html). <!-- [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/ImageRatingStudy) -->
* [Retaliate or Carry-on: Reactive AGression Experiment (RC-RAGE)](https://kywch.github.io/RC-RAGE_jsPsych/rc-rage-demo.html): An improved costly-reactive-aggression paradigm (work-in-progress). <!-- [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/RC-RAGE_jsPsych) -->
* [Stop-Signal Task (STOP-IT)](https://kywch.github.io/STOP-IT/jsPsych_version/experiment-transformed-third.html): Adapted the [original code]( https://github.com/fredvbrug/STOP-IT) by [Verbruggen and colleagues (2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46323).
* [BubbleView Task](https://kywch.github.io/BubbleView_jsPsych/): Adapted the [original code](https://github.com/namwkim/bubbleview) by [Kim and colleagues (2017)](http://bubbleview.namwkim.org/). <!-- [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/BubbleView_jsPsych) -->
* [Perceptual Metacognition Task](https://kywch.github.io/Perceptual-Metacognition/): Adapted the [original code](https://expfactory.github.io/v1/perceptual_metacognition.html) by [Sochat and colleagues (2016)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00610/full).
* Working memory tasks: [Backward Digit Span Task](https://kywch.github.io/WorkingMemoryTasks/backward-digit-span-adaptive.html) and [Dual N-Back Task](https://kywch.github.io/WorkingMemoryTasks/dual-nback.html). <!-- [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/WorkingMemoryTasks) -->

### Math Anxiety & Avoidance Decision-Making
The [Choose-And-Solve Task (CAST)](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych) is a novel effort-based decision-making task in which participants chose between solving easy, low-reward problems and hard, high-reward problems in both math and nonmath contexts. 
Higher levels of math anxiety were associated with a tendency to select easier, low-reward problems over harder, high-reward math (but not word) problems, suggesting that **we cannot even pay math-anxious people to do hard math.** Addressing math avoidance behaviors can help break the vicious cycle of math anxiety and increase interest and success in STEM fields. Please see [the paper (Choe et al., 2019, *Science Advances*)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaay1062).
