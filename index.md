## Research Highlights
I use simple online games, brain imaging, eye-tracking, and machine learning to study how the internal and external environment affects human decision-making. I currently investigates (1) neurocognitive mechanisms of math anxiety and math avoidance, (2) neurocognitive benefits of the superior pedestrian experience, and (3) neurocognitive impacts of heat stress on aggressive behavior and decision-making.
