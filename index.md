## Research Highlights
I use web-based cognitive tasks, brain imaging, eye-tracking, and machine learning to study how the internal and external environment affects human decision-making. My current research focuses on (1) neurocognitive mechanisms of math anxiety and math avoidance, (2) neurocognitive benefits of the superior pedestrian experience, and (3) neurocognitive impacts of heat stress on self-control and aggression. During my PhD, I studied the role of human primary visual cortex in perceptual decision-making.

### Web-based Cognitive Tasks
These tasks are based on [the jsPsych library](https://www.jspsych.org/) and have been used in my research (with Qualtrics). You can try these right now! NOTE: These tasks are **NOT** designed to work on mobile phones and tablets.

* [The Choose-And-Solve Task](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/choose-and-solve-task.html): An effort-based decision-making task for measuring math avoidance [(Choe et al., 2019, *Science Advances*)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaay1062). [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/CAST_jsPsych)
* [Multi-Image Rating Task](https://kywch.github.io/ImageRatingStudy/multi-rating.html): An efficient method for rating images (work-in-progress) vs. [pairwise image rating](https://kywch.github.io/ImageRatingStudy/pair-rating.html). [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/ImageRatingStudy)
* [Retaliate or Carry-on: Reactive AGression Experiment (RC-RAGE)](https://kywch.github.io/RC-RAGE_jsPsych/): An ecologically-valid costly reactive aggression paradigm (work-in-progress). [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/RC-RAGE_jsPsych)
* [Stop-Signal Task (STOP-IT)](https://kywch.github.io/RC-RAGE_jsPsych/stop-signal.html): Adapted the [original code]( https://github.com/fredvbrug/STOP-IT) by [Verbruggen and colleagues (2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46323).
* [BubbleView Task](https://kywch.github.io/BubbleView_jsPsych/): Adapted the [original code](https://github.com/namwkim/bubbleview) by [Kim and colleagues (2017)](http://bubbleview.namwkim.org/). [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/BubbleView_jsPsych)
* Working memory tasks: [Backward Digit Span Task](https://kywch.github.io/WorkingMemoryTasks/backward-digit-span-adaptive.html) and [Dual N-Back Task](https://kywch.github.io/WorkingMemoryTasks/dual-nback.html). [\[code\]](https://github.com/kywch/WorkingMemoryTasks)
