excerpt: "Higher levels of math anxiety were associated with a tendency to select easier, low-reward problems over harder, high-reward math problems, suggesting that we cannot even pay math-anxious people to do hard math."

The [Choose-And-Solve Task (CAST)](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych) is a novel effort-based decision-making task in which participants chose between solving easy, low-reward problems and hard, high-reward problems in both math and nonmath contexts.

## Key Finding

Higher levels of math anxiety were associated with a tendency to select easier, low-reward problems over harder, high-reward math (but not word) problems, suggesting that **we cannot even pay math-anxious people to do hard math.**

Addressing math avoidance behaviors can help break the vicious cycle of math anxiety and increase interest and success in STEM fields.

## About the Task

The Choose-And-Solve Task measures how people make effort-based decisions when faced with math versus non-math problems. Participants can choose between:

- **Easy, low-reward problems** (earn less money, but easier to solve)
- **Hard, high-reward problems** (earn more money, but more difficult)

By comparing choices in math vs. word problem contexts, we can measure math-specific avoidance behaviors that go beyond general cognitive effort avoidance.
