Assembled open-source robot hands, thinking: if robot hands can make robot hands can make robot hands can...

Robot hand assembly could serve as an excellent benchmark for robot manipulation, similar to how coding benchmarks work for LLMs. Who knew 5 years ago that LLMs would code so well?

We'll probably have very capable robot hands within 2 years, soon followed by sophisticated commodity generalist policies. Yeah, the 2030s will be very different, and I joined RLWRLD to ride this wave.

The parallel to LLM coding benchmarks is apt: we need clear, measurable tasks that drive progress. Hand assembly is:
- Objectively measurable
- Incrementally improvable
- Practically useful
- Self-referential (hands building hands)

This kind of recursive improvement is exactly what we saw with code generation models, and I expect similar acceleration in robotics.
