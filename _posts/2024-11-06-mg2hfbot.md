I wanted to test LeRobot on complex tasks without a physical robot arm. MimicGen has 26K+ demonstrations across 12 tasks. I created mg2hfbot to convert datasets, train LeRobot & RoboMimic policies, and evaluate them.

## The Problem

Testing robot learning algorithms typically requires either:
- Access to physical robot hardware (expensive, time-consuming)
- Simple simulation environments (not representative of real challenges)

MimicGen provides a middle ground: high-quality demonstrations of complex manipulation tasks in simulation.

## The Solution

**mg2hfbot** bridges MimicGen and LeRobot:
- Converts MimicGen datasets to HuggingFace format
- Trains both LeRobot and RoboMimic policies
- Provides evaluation tools for both frameworks
- Enables rapid experimentation without physical hardware
