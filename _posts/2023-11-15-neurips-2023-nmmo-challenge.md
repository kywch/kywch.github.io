The NeurIPS 2023 Neural MMO Challenge ($20K in prizes) is now live on AICrowd and runs until December! Train agents that generalize to new tasks, maps, and opponents.

**Competition URL:** [aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-the-neural-mmo-challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-the-neural-mmo-challenge)

## Competition Timeline

- **October:** Competition launches - warm-up rounds vs. baselines
- **November-December:** Main competition. Task completion evaluated against other participants' Agent policies. Competition tasks get harder over rounds.
- **Before NeurIPS:** Submissions close, final evaluation of top 16 submissions in each track
- **NeurIPS:** Winners notified!

## Awards and Prizes

$20K in prizes sponsored by Parametrix.ai. Winners will co-author the summary manuscript following the competition.

## The Challenge

The Neural MMO Challenge tests agents on:
- **Generalization** to new tasks not seen during training
- **Adaptation** to different map configurations
- **Robustness** when facing diverse opponent strategies
- **Multi-agent coordination** in team settings

This competition directly informed the development of [Meta MMO](/blog/2024/06/meta-mmo-release/), which incorporated lessons learned and made the environment 3x faster.

## What Came Next

After the competition, I gave a [talk at NeurIPS 2023](/blog/2023/12/neurips-2023-talk/) about the insights gained, which led to the [Meta MMO release](/blog/2024/06/meta-mmo-release/) in 2024.
