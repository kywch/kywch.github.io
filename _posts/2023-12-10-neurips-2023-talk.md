Excited to speak about Neural MMO at NeurIPS and discuss how NMMO can support open-ended multi-agent RL research! If you are in this space, let's connect.

## Recorded Talk

Watch the talk here: [Neural MMO mini games preview: Generating diverse and dynamic multi-agent learning environments](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/83943)

## What I Covered

The talk presents early work on Neural MMO minigames, which later evolved into [Meta MMO](/blog/2024/06/meta-mmo-release/). Key themes:

- Why open-ended multi-agent environments matter for RL research
- How to generate diverse and dynamic learning environments
- The path from competition to research platform

## Context

This talk came shortly after the [2023 Neural MMO Challenge](/blog/2023/11/neurips-2023-nmmo-challenge/) and helped shape the direction that led to Meta MMO.

## Connect

If you're working in multi-agent RL, especially on open-ended environments, I'd love to connect and discuss!
