I had never used React before, but with Claude Artifacts I was able to make a web app and deploy it on GitHub. The process was interactive, and I could ask questions about the code. While I edited some code, most of it was generated by an LLM. It was a strange experience, but I'm sure this will become more common.

## The Need

For my literature reviews, I want a whiteboard where I can move sticky notes around and write text here and there. I have used Google Slides, but I also want to add links and other stuff. So I made a React app called Card Table, with much help from Claude.

## The App

**Try it here:** [kywch.github.io/card-table](https://kywch.github.io/card-table/)

Features:
- Movable cards/sticky notes
- Text editing with links
- Persistent state
- Simple, focused interface

## Resources

- **Code:** [github.com/kywch/card-table](https://github.com/kywch/card-table)
- **Deployment tool:** [claude-artifact-runner](https://github.com/claudio-silva/claude-artifact-runner) by Claudio Silva
